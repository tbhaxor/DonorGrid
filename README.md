# DonorGrid

> Accept donations from around the globe instantly

DonorGrid is a ready-to-use headless donor management system for NGOs and other similar organization provided for free. It can be used with literally any website and make it accept donation in no-time (of course integration time excluded).

I have been inspired for this project from https://youwecan.org. It not only solves the problem for SMBs who take responsibility to build donation websites but also help the donors to donate money in their currencies.
