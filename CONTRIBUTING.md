# Contribution Guidelines

We follow the coding convention strictly and expect the same from you. Here are some examples we have extended from [Django Coding Style](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/writing-code/coding-style/)

1. If you want to add a new feature, create its app
2. Prefer single quotes only, use escape character.


## Scope of Contribution

1. Landing Page (check docs folder in `feature/landing-page` branch)
2. Issues and [Unchecked Feature](https://github.com/tbhaxor/DonorGrid#feature)
3. Typos in the documentation, readme or application
4. Improving the code quality
5. Adding more unit tests
6. Optimize deployment process
